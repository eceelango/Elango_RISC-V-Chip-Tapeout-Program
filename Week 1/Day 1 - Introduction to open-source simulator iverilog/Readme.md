# SKY130RTL D1SK1 L1 Introduction to iverilog design test bench

**Simulator**
+ Tool used for checking the functionality of the design
+ iVerilog is open source Verilog Simulator
+ Design: Represnted as a Verilog HDL
+ **TestBench:** Setup to apply stimulus to the design under test to check the functionality
+ **Simulator:** Looks fo rchanges the in the input accordingly the output will be evaluated
