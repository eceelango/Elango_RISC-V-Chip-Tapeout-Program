# Elango_RISC-V-Chip-Tapeout-Program
This 20-week RISC-V SoC chip tapeout program by VSD &amp; IITG demonstrates a full tapeout cycle for a RISC-V reference SoC using Synopsys tools and SCL180 nm PDK. 

## Program Description
This Program focuses on the RISC-V SoC Chip tapeout program organized by VLSI System Design (VSD) &IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN). This 20‑week Program will demonstrate a complete tapeout cycle for a RISC‑V Reference SoC using Synopsys tools and the SCL180 nm PDK. This Program is part of India’s Semiconductor Mission, aiming to create skilled VLSI designers and emphasize fabrication at National foundries (SCL). This Program will create the next wave of innovation in VLSI.(https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/soc-labs/)
